                <p>Thank you for participating in our study! <b>Please read the following instructions carefully.</b></p>
                <p>Please note that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will see each image for only two seconds, but you will have as much time as you want to answer the two questions. It is important that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>You pay attention to the image while it is displayed, i.e., right after you clicked the <i>"Next"</i> button.</li>
                            <li>You <b>do not accidentally invert</b> your responses (e.g., responding "very difficult" instead of "very easy"). Take your time to answer if needed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You will see each photo several times during the experiment, with different filters applied to them. You will notice these repetitions, but please try to respond to questions as if you were seeing each photo for the first time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If anything is unclear or if you have any question, please ask the experimenter now.</p>
                <p>Once you are ready to start the experiment, click the <i>"Next"</i> button below.</p>
