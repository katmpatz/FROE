        <p>
          <b>Main researcher: </b> Katerina Batziakoudi, Oleksandra Vereschak, Gilles Bailly, Baptiste Caramiaux 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Research location: </b>   Internet study
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Research goal: </b>  The goal of this experiment is to study trust in AI recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- <b>What do we expect from you: </b>  If you agree to participate in the study, you will be shown apartments for rental and will be asked questions such as to evaluate how surprising is their price or the price prediction. The entire experiment will take approximately <?php echo $config["Prolific"]["experiment_duration"]; ?> minutes. -->
          <b>What do we expect from you: </b> If you agree to participate in the study, you will estimate prices of rental units for an undisclosed location. You will get familirized with the market and you will answer several questions about your perception of your answers and of AI recommendations. To avoid potential technical issues, we suggest using a computer with the latest Chrome version and a stable internet connection. The entire experiment will take approximately 30 minutes.
